# TXT Generator

Gets all text written in PPTx files from slide 2 (the main purpose of this code was to get lyrics from slides and in the first slide it is usually done to mention song name and author).

# Usage
Go to src/index.js and change the `SLIDES_PATH` to be the path of the directory containing all slide presentations you want to have the txt files.

If you want to change the output directory, change the `LYRICS_PATH` containing in src/index.js file.

Run `yarn start` after installing all dependencies.
